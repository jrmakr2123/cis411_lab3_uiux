# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com) | Score 1 | Summary 1 |
| [Flexjobs.com](https://www.flexjobs.com) | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Site 1: Indeed.com
<!-- Insert Recorded Screenshots with captions and steps. -->
### Indeed homepage
![Indeed homepage](/src/indeed%201.png)
From the homepage, Indeed feels exactly how a job searching website should be. The homepage opens up to available jobs in your area. Since my preferred location is remote (being in college and all), remote is automatically selected and jobs appear. 

![Indeed jobs](/src/indeed%203.png)
The jobs are all listed to the left.
Once you select a job . . .

then the selected job will appear on the right. This will then show details like the job description, the job benefits, and even the wages. I will admit, the thoroughness of the descriptions on indeed will change from employer to employer. To actually apply for the position you hit the blue Apply Now button or blue Apply on company site button. 

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Quite intuitive. The website easily conveys its purpose to the user and guides them to applying for a job.   |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | Short answer: yes. The moment you go on Indeed.com you see jobs even if you are not signed in.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 1  | To actually apply, you click the apply now button. This step is clear. Everything after this is objectively not clear.  The information required to apply and the length of the process is unknown. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | Absolutely. So long as you a signed in, the information, things you are interested in (job wise), and the location you want to work will influence the results you receive.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |2   | The site obviously copied a couple of key phrases to help entice potential applicants. This was seen more on the employer side though.   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  2 | The site included a simple enough interface that helped me understand the process.   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3   | Just by using my keyboard, I was able to select a suitable job and run a pseudo application for it.   |
| **TOTAL** | 17  |   |
